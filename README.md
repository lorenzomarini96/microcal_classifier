# microcal_classifier
Convolutional neural networks for the CMEP course. This project Compare the performance of a CNN classification on a microcalcification image dataset, with the performance obtained in an analysis pipeline where the mammographic images containing either microcalcifications or normal tissue are represented in terms of wavelet coefficients.
